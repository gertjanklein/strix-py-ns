# strix-py-ns

Python namespace object supporting both ns.value and ns['value'].
Intended use is to represent configuration files. To that end, a few
functions are also present to ease checking configuration validity.

The namespace module in this repository is used in
[copy-iris-items](https://github.com/gertjanklein/copy-iris-items)
and
[iris-export-builder](https://github.com/gertjanklein/iris-export-builder),
and was originally developed there.

Documentation is to be completed.
